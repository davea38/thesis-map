# Attachments

Nodes support citations and free-form notes.

## Overview

Each node can have **zero or more attachments**. Attachments provide supporting evidence, references, or supplementary material for a node's claim.

## Attachment Types

### Citation

A reference to an external source:
- **URL** — Link to the source
- **Article title** — Name of the referenced work
- **Quote snippet** — A relevant excerpt from the source

At least one field must be non-empty — a completely blank citation is not valid.

### Note

A **free-form text block** for supplementary commentary, quotes, or tangential thoughts. This is separate from the node's main free text body field.

**Body vs Note distinction:** The node's body is the author's primary reasoning or argument for the claim. Note attachments are for supplementary material the author wants to track separately — e.g., a related observation, a counterpoint to investigate later, or a reference quote that doesn't warrant a full citation.

## File Attachments (Future)

File and image uploads are **deferred from MVP**. This will be added in a future phase. MVP supports citations and notes only.

## Management

- Attachments are managed from the **node's detail side panel**
- Multiple attachments of any type can exist on a single node
- Users can **add, edit, and remove** attachments from the side panel
- Existing attachments can be **edited in place** (not just add/remove)
- Attachments are displayed in **creation order**. No manual reordering for MVP.
