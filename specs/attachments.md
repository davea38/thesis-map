# Attachments

Nodes support citations, free-form notes, and file/image attachments.

## Overview

Each node can have **zero or more attachments**. Attachments provide supporting evidence, references, or supplementary material for a node's claim.

## Attachment Types

### Citation

A reference to an external source:
- **URL** — Link to the source
- **Article title** — Name of the referenced work
- **Quote snippet** — A relevant excerpt from the source

All three fields are optional — a citation can have any combination.

### Note

A **free-form text block** for additional commentary or context. This is separate from the node's main free text body field, allowing users to keep structured notes as distinct attachments.

### File

An **uploaded file or image**. Supports any file type the user needs to attach as evidence or reference material.

## Management

- Attachments are managed from the **node's detail side panel**
- Multiple attachments of any type can exist on a single node
- Users can add and remove attachments from the side panel
