# Radial Layout

The map displays as a radial mind map with the thesis centered.

## Layout

- The **thesis (root node)** sits at the center of the canvas
- **Direct children** radiate outward from the center
- **Deeper levels** extend further outward in concentric rings
- **Connection lines** link each parent to its children

## Canvas Interaction

- The canvas supports **pan** (click-drag on empty space) and **zoom** (scroll wheel or pinch)
- The layout should remain readable at various zoom levels

## Visual Indicators

### Polarity

- Nodes should be **visually distinguishable by polarity** (e.g., color-coded)
- Tailwind and headwind nodes use distinct colors so the user can see the argument structure at a glance

### Groups

- Groups should be **visually indicated** on the map
- Possible approaches: shared background region, color tint, or visual clustering of group members
- The group name should be visible near its member nodes
